## Contributing Guidelines (For Interns / Collaborators)

All interns added as collaborators to this repository must follow the branch workflow below. **Direct commits or pushes to the `main` branch are not allowed.**

> Note: `main` only contains the `LICENSE` and `README.md` — it is not used for active development. There is no need to pull the latest `main` into your branch at any point.

### 1. Branch Naming

- Every intern must create their own branch off `main`, named after themselves.
- Suggested naming convention: `firstname-lastname` (all lowercase, hyphen-separated).
  - Example: `john-doe`, `aisha-khan`

### 2. How to Create Your Branch

**Option A — Clone and push (recommended)**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/springboardmentor442n-coder/Network-Anomaly-Detection-and-Predictive-Intrusion-Monitoring-Platform.git

# Move into the project folder
cd Network-Anomaly-Detection-and-Predictive-Intrusion-Monitoring-Platform

# Create and switch to your own branch (off main)
git checkout -b your-name

# ... make your changes ...

# Stage, commit, and push your changes to YOUR branch only
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your change here"
git push origin your-name
```

**Option B — GitHub UI upload**

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Switch the branch dropdown from `main` to your own branch (create it first via **Branch: main → View all branches → New branch**, named after yourself).
3. Once on your branch, use **Add file → Upload files** to upload your code.
4. Commit directly to your branch (not `main`).

### 3. Rules

- ❌ Do **not** push or upload code directly to `main`.
- ❌ Do **not** push code to another intern's branch.
- ✅ Only push/upload code to the branch that carries your own name.
- Keep uploading/pushing your code to your branch regularly as you make progress. No pull requests are required — your branch itself is the deliverable.

### 4. Summary

| Action | Allowed? |

| Create your own branch from `main` | ✅ Yes |
